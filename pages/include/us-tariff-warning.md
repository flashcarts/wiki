NDS-Card is [no longer accepting orders from US customers](https://www.nds-card.com/NewsShow.asp?NewsID=1344) as of 04/18/2025. This is due to the 245% tariff policy on Chinese goods which will come into effect on 05/02/2025. If you are from the US, you should order from AliExpress instead, as they appear to be unaffected by this so far. We are closely monitoring the situation. Feel free to [contact us](/contact) for more info.
