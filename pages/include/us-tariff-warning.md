Due to high tariffs on Chinese goods, NDS-Card is [no longer accepting orders from US customers](https://www.nds-card.com/NewsShow.asp?NewsID=1344). **If you are from the US, you should order from AliExpress instead.** However, do keep in mind that you will be charged extra for import fees. This is sometimes included with the total price, as is the case with choice sellers, but oftentimes it is not, so you need to read the listing carefully. Some of the listings we have linked below may not be available in the US. We are closely monitoring the situation. Feel free to [contact us](/contact) for more info.
