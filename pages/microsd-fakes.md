This page aims to detail the issues surrounding counterfeit MicroSD cards, as well as MicroSD cards sold under the brand name of real companies that do not sell MicroSD cards (known as "brandjacking").

It's important to avoid buying counterfeit MicroSD cards as you may experience data loss & slow performance.

**All information on this page generally also applies to full size SD cards.**

## (Overview) Checklist to avoid fake MicroSD Cards

- ✓ Always buy from a well known trusted retailer (Some brands also operate their own online stores).
- ✗ Avoid AliExpress, Temu, Shein and Wish for MicroSD cards.
- ✓ Always go for name brand MicroSD cards.
- ✗ Avoid brands you do not recognise.
- ✓ Check that the MicroSD is a real model the brand sells.
- ✗ If the price is too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.

If you suspect that you may have a fake MicroSD card, you can test it by following the instructions laid out in the [Testing a MicroSD Card](#testing-a-microsd-card) section of this page.

### Fake MicroSD Cards

Fake MicroSD cards are becoming increasingly common on online marketplaces.

They will typically look similar to genuine MicroSD cards and will be fakes of popular name brands. They're often paired with an attractive price and fake reviews (or simply reviews from users who do not realise they have purchased a fake MicroSD card).

Counterfeit MicroSD cards will often have low-quality markings on the label, the incorrect font or be misaligned.
If they come in branded packaging, the packaging will often be a low-quality photocopy, have the incorrect font and/or have spelling mistakes.

**Below is an example of a genuine Samsung MicroSD card compared to a counterfeit. The stars highlight the differences:**

#### Fake capacities and performance

Fake MicroSD cards will often use low-quality flash memory with a fraudulently spoofed capacity. What will appear as a 512GB MicroSD card on your computer may actually be 64GB instead or maybe even less. Their performance is often quite poor too, not meeting their advertised read and write speeds. Its common these days to see cards marked as 2TB being sold for bargain basement prices, these are absolutely not genuine and users have reported their real capacity being as low as 8GB.

The only way to identify whether or not your MicroSD card is fake is to test it. There are instructions at [the bottom of this page](#testing-a-microsd-card) detailing how you can do just that. Looking at the MicroSD card's properties will not reveal the fraud. Similarly, reformatting or repartitioning a fake MicroSD card will not "fix" its capacity. The card has specifically been manufactured to always show its fake capacity. It cannot write data past its real capacity and thus should not be trusted with important data. Even if you know its real capacity, you cannot guarantee that your data is safe.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsWx1iO-aeA) outlines a lot of important information when it comes to counterfeit MicroSD cards and their capacities/performance. It was made back in 2023; however, the information it contains is still true today.

If you want to ensure what you are buying is genuine, try to buy directly from the manufacturer's website or one of their authorised sellers which many list on their website.

### Fake brands that don't exist

Often called "no-name" or "generic" MicroSD cards, these are MicroSD cards sold under random brand names, sometimes made to sound similar to reputable brands (e.g., "SanDian"). These cards are typically the same as counterfeit cards, encompassing low-quality flash storage and/or a fake capacity and should also be avoided. It's always important to only purchase brands you recognise.

No-name MicroSD cards are commonly included with preloaded Nintendo DS flashcarts and likewise use low quality flash storage and will typically stop working or become defective in a short period of time.

**Below are some examples:**

![No-name Unbranded MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/generic.png){:width="200"}

<sup>These examples were spotted on several online marketplaces.</sup>

### Brandjacking

Brandjacking is a tactic used by counterfeiters to sell a product fraudulently using the brand of a real company when that brand does not sell the product in question.
This tactic fools consumers into believing they are buying a name-brand product. This is very common on online marketplaces, such as AliExpress and Amazon.

The below brands **DO NOT** sell MicroSD cards. Any MicroSD cards bearing these brand names are employing brandjacking and are counterfeit:

- Xiaomi
- Mi
- Huawei (Huawei only sell their own proprietary "NM Card" Memory cards for certain smartphones).
- Sony (Sony only sell professional/industrial grade SD cards and have discontinued their MicroSD cards).

**Examples of MicroSD cards using brandjacking:**

![fake Huawei MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/huawei-fake.png){:width="200"}
![fake Xiaomi MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/xiaomi-fake.png){:width="200"} 
![fake Sony MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/sony-fake.png){:width="200"}

<sup>These examples were spotted on several online marketplaces and are all unofficial and will likely have a fake capacity and poor quality memory.</sup>

There are some cases where a brand will sell MicroSD cards, but counterfeit cards posing as non-existent models exist on online marketplaces, usually bearing a generic design or the design of another brand. It is advised to check the manufacturer's website to ensure they sell the displayed model if you are unsure.

### Where to buy genuine MicroSD cards?

There are various ways to ensure you are getting a genuine product.

- Always buy from a trusted & reputable big name retailer.
- Avoid buying MicroSD cards from online shopping marketplaces such as AliExpress, Wish, Temu & Shein.
- Some name brands like Sandisk, Samsung and Kingston have official online stores to buy genuine MicroSD cards directly from them. Other name brands will typically have a list of authorised sellers on their website.
    - Sandisk: [Online Store](https://shop.sandisk.com/product-portfolio/memory-cards/microsd-cards) --- [Authorised Sellers](https://shop.sandisk.com/company/distributors)
    - Samsung: [Online Store](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/)
    - Kingston: [Online Store](https://shop.kingston.com/collections/memory-cards/Memory-Card)
    - Lexar: [Authorised Sellers](https://www.lexar.com/global/store/)
    - Kioxia (Formerly Toshiba): [Authorised Sellers](https://europe.kioxia.com/en-europe/personal/support/buy.html)
    - This isn't a complete list, it is here to serve as an example.
- If you are buying from Amazon, ensure the product listing states that it is both "Sold" and "Shipped" by Amazon. "Fulfilled by Amazon" but sold by a different seller does not guarantee you will get a genuine product.

### Testing a MicroSD Card

This section contains instructions on testing your MicroSD card for fake storage. Select the operating system you are using below to find specific instructions for your machine.

{% capture tab-windows %}

## Windows

{% capture tab-validrive %}

### ValiDrive

ValiDrive can perform spot-checks on storage devices to verify whether or not the capacity they report is genuine. It is *very* fast in determining if a device has fake storage attached to it. However, it will often not catch cases where the reported capacity is real, but the storage is defective in some way. If you are looking to test for defective storage rather than fake storage capacities, you should follow the `H2TestW` instructions instead.

1. Download ValiDrive from GRC's website: <https://www.grc.com/validrive.htm>
2. Once it has finished downloading, open ValiDrive and give it administrator privileges when prompted.
3. Click the `Check USB Drive` button, then insert your MicroSD card when it tells you to.
4. Wait for the test to complete.

Here is an example of the ValiDrive results obtained from a genuine storage device:

![Good ValiDrive map](/assets/images/microsd/validrive-good.png) 

Real, functional storage will only show green squares in the results. If there are any blue, red, or yellow squares shown in the results from ValiDrive, the storage device being tested is likely to be fake/defective and therefore should not be used. An example of the results obtained from a fake storage device can also be seen in the image below:

{% endcapture %}
{% assign tab-validrive = tab-validrive | split: "////////" %}

{% capture tab-h2testw %}

### H2TestW

H2TestW works by first filling up the free space of a storage device with test data. Then it will verify that the test data can be read back correctly. It is far slower than ValiDrive at identifying fake storage. It is better suited for cases where the reported storage capacity is real, but the storage itself is defective.

1. Download H2TestW from it's official website: <https://www.heise.de/ct/Redaktion/bo/downloads/h2testw_1.4.zip>
2. Once it has finished downloading, open H2TestW. You may wish to change the language at this point.
3. Click `Select target` and choose to use your SD card.
4. Ensure that `all available space` is selected, then click `Write + Verify`.
5. Wait for the tests to complete. This will take a while.

If the test finishes without errors, the storage device should be good to use. However, if the progress bar turns red and data is marked as having been lost, the storage device is fake and/or defective and should not be used.

### F3

F3 includes two programs known as `f3read` and `f3write`. They both work in a similar manner to H2TestW on Windows. `f3write` is first used to fill up the free space of a storage device with 1GB files. `f3read` will verify that it can read in the data from those files correctly.

{:start="0"}
0. Install F3 using either [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (`brew install f3`) or [MacPorts](https://guide.macports.org/) (`port install f3`).
1. Insert the MicroSD card to be tested into your computer.
2. Backup and remove all of the data stored on the MicroSD card so that the full storage capacity of it can be tested.
3. Run `f3write /Volumes/<SD card name>` in a terminal and wait for the process to complete. This may take a while.
4. Once f3write is finished, run `f3read /Volumes/<SD card name>` in a terminal. This may also take a while to complete.

Here is an example of the results obtained from testing a genuine MicroSD card:

```
$ f3read /Volumes/SD\ CARD
F3 read 9.0

```

If there is any data marked as having been lost, you should replace the MicroSD card as it is either fake, or is dying and should not be used. If everything is OK, you can delete all of the `*.h2w` files from the MicroSD card and use it as you normally would.

## Linux

{% capture tab-f3probe %}

### F3 Probe

`f3probe` is one of the extra programs that F3 provides. It can be used to quickly determine if a storage device is faking it's real capacity. If you are looking to test for defective storage rather than fake storage capacities, you should follow the `F3 Read/Write` instructions instead.

**Note:** You must run this tool as root in order for it to work!

{:start="0"}
0. Install F3 using your distribution's package manager.
    - If F3 is not available in the distro’s package repositories, you should compile F3 from source instead. You can find the instructions to do this here: <https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3> - ensure that you compile the extra applications too as that is required for `f3probe`.
1. Insert the MicroSD card to be tested into your computer.
2. Run `f3probe /dev/<device>` in a terminal as root.
    - If you get an error stating that you have run out of memory, run `f3probe --min-memory /dev/<device>` instead.
    - If the error persists, backup all of the data on the storage device, then run `f3probe --destructive /dev/<device>`. It is *essential* that you backup the data stored on the device beforehand as this will, as the option implies, destroy it.
3. Wait for the test to complete.

Here is an example of the results obtained from testing a genuine MicroSD card:

```
# f3probe /dev/sdb
F3 probe 9.0

WARNING: Probing normally takes from a few seconds to 15 minutes, but
         it can take longer. Please be patient.

Probe finished, recovering blocks... Done

Good news: The device `/dev/sdb' is the real thing

Device geometry:
                 *Usable* size: 29.12 GB (61071360 blocks)
                Announced size: 29.12 GB (61071360 blocks)
                        Module: 32.00 GB (2^35 Bytes)
        Approximate cache size: 0.00 Byte (0 blocks), need-reset=no
           Physical block size: 512.00 Byte (2^9 Bytes)

Probe time: 1'22"
```

If you instead get one of the following messages:

- `Bad news: The device '/dev/<device>' is damaged`
- `Bad news: The device '/dev/<device>' is counterfeit of type [...]`

You should replace your MicroSD card. It is either fake, or damaged to the point where it should no longer be used.

{% assign tab-f3probe = tab-f3probe | split: "////////" %}

{% capture tab-f3rw %}

### F3 Read/Write

F3 includes two programs known as `f3read` and `f3write`. They both work in a similar manner to H2TestW on Windows. `f3write` is first used to fill up the free space of a storage device with 1GB files. `f3read` will verify that it can read in the data from those files correctly.

{:start="0"}
0. Install F3 using your distribution's package manager.
    - If F3 is not available in the distro's package repositories, you should compile F3 from source instead. You can find the instructions to do this here: <https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3>
1. Insert the MicroSD card to be tested into your computer and mount it.
2. Backup and remove all of the data stored on the MicroSD card so that the full storage capacity of it can be tested.
3. Run `f3write <mount point>` in a terminal and wait for the process to complete. This may take a while.
4. Once f3write is finished, run `f3read <mount point>` in a terminal. This may also take a while to complete.

Here is an example of the results obtained from testing a genuine MicroSD card:

```
