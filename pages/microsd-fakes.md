### Fake MicroSD Cards

Fake MicroSD cards are increasingly common on online marketplaces.

They will typically look similar to genuine MicroSD cards and will be fakes of popular name brands and often paired with an attractive price and fake reviews (or simply reviews from users who do not realise they have purchased a fake MicroSD card).

Counterfeit MicroSD cards will often have low quality markings on the label, the incorrect font or be misaligned.
If they come in branded packaging, the packaging will often be a low quality photocopy, have the incorrect font or have spelling mistakes.

**Below is an example of a genuine Samsung MicroSD card compared to a counterfeit. The stars highlight the differences:**

#### Fake capacities and performance

Fake MicroSD cards will often use low quality flash memory and not meet their advertised speed specifications, and often have fake capacities, for example a common tactic is to sell a 64GB card that is labeled as 512GB, the 64GB card has been programmed & manufactured to show it has 512GB of storage when connected to a computer.

You can test a suspected fake MicroSD card using variety of tools. These tools will will write a data pattern to the MicroSD card and then read it back to confirm if all the data is intact. A MicroSD card with a fake capacity will fail these tests.

- Windows Users: [H2TestW](http://www.heise.de/ct/Redaktion/bo/downloads/h2testw_1.4.zip) --- [Validrive](https://www.grc.com/validrive.htm) (Validrive is much faster at testing MicroSD card capacities but is not advised for testing for defective storage).

- Linux Users: [F3](https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3/releases/latest)

Re-formatting a fake MicroSD card will not "fix" it's capacity. The card has specifically been manufactured to always show it's fake capacity and will not save data past it's real capacity and thus should not be trusted with important data.

### Fake brands that don't exist

Often called "no-name" or "generic" MicroSD cards, these are MicroSD cards sold under random brand names or similar sounding names that do not exist as any reputable brand. These cards as typically the same as counterfeit cards, encompassing low quality flash storage and/or a fake capacity and should also be avoided. It's always important to only purchase brands you recognise.

### Brandjacking

Brandjacking is a tactic used by counterfeiters to sell a product fraudulently using the brand of a real company when that brand does not sell the product in question.
This tactic fools consumers into believing they are buying a name-brand product. This has been used more increasingly on online marketplaces such as Aliexpress.

The below brands **DO NOT** sell MicroSD cards. Any MicroSD cards bearing these brand names are employing brandjacking and are counterfeit:

- Lenovo
- Xiaomi
- Mi
- Huawei (Huawei only sell their own proprietary "NM Card" Memory cards for certain smartphones).
- Thinkplus
- Sony (Sony only sell professional/industrial grade SD cards and have discontinued their MicroSD cards).
