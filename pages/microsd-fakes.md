### Fake MicroSD Cards

Fake MicroSD cards are becoming increasingly common on online marketplaces.

They will typically look similar to genuine MicroSD cards and will be fakes of popular name brands. They're often paired with an attractive price and fake reviews (or simply reviews from users who do not realise they have purchased a fake MicroSD card).

Counterfeit MicroSD cards will often have low-quality markings on the label, the incorrect font or be misaligned.
If they come in branded packaging, the packaging will often be a low-quality photocopy, have the incorrect font and/or have spelling mistakes.

#### Fake capacities and performance

Fake MicroSD cards will often use low-quality flash memory with a fraudulently spoofed capacity. What will appear as a 512GB MicroSD card on your computer may actually be 64GB instead or maybe even less. Their performance is often quite poor too, not meeting their advertised read and write speeds. Its common these days to see cards marked as 2TB being sold for bargain basement prices, these are absolutely not genuine and users have reported their real capacity being as low as 8GB.

You can test a suspected fake MicroSD card using a variety of tools. These tools will write a data pattern to the MicroSD card and then read it back to confirm that all the data is intact. A MicroSD card with a fake capacity will fail these tests.

- Windows Users: [H2TestW](http://www.heise.de/ct/Redaktion/bo/downloads/h2testw_1.4.zip) --- [Validrive](https://www.grc.com/validrive.htm) (Validrive is much faster at testing MicroSD cards for capacity fraud, **but is not advised for testing for defective storage**).
- Mac Users: [F3XSwift](https://github.com/vrunkel/F3XSwift/releases/latest)
- Linux Users: [F3](https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3/releases/latest)

Looking at the MicroSD card's properties will not reveal the fraud. Similarly, reformatting or repartitioning a fake MicroSD card will not "fix" its capacity. The card has specifically been manufactured to always show its fake capacity. It cannot write data past its real capacity and thus should not be trusted with important data. Even if you know its real capacity, you cannot guarantee that your data is safe.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsWx1iO-aeA) outlines a lot of important information when it comes to counterfeit MicroSD cards and their capacities/performance. It was made back in 2023; however, the information it contains is still true today.

If you want to ensure what you are buying is genuine, try to buy directly from the manufacturer's website or one of their authorised sellers which many list on their website.

### Fake brands that don't exist

Often called "no-name" or "generic" MicroSD cards, these are MicroSD cards sold under random brand names, sometimes made to sound similar to reputable brands (e.g., "SanDian"). These cards are typically the same as counterfeit cards, encompassing low-quality flash storage and/or a fake capacity and should also be avoided. It's always important to only purchase brands you recognise.

No-name MicroSD cards are commonly included with preloaded Nintendo DS flashcarts and likewise use low quality flash storage and will typically stop working or become defective in a short period of time.

**Below are some examples:**

<sup>These examples were spotted on several online marketplaces.</sup>

### Brandjacking

Brandjacking is a tactic used by counterfeiters to sell a product fraudulently using the brand of a real company when that brand does not sell the product in question.
This tactic fools consumers into believing they are buying a name-brand product. This is very common on online marketplaces, such as AliExpress and Amazon.

The below brands **DO NOT** sell MicroSD cards. Any MicroSD cards bearing these brand names are employing brandjacking and are counterfeit:

- Xiaomi
- Mi
- Huawei (Huawei only sell their own proprietary "NM Card" Memory cards for certain smartphones).
- Sony (Sony only sell professional/industrial grade SD cards and have discontinued their MicroSD cards).

**Examples of MicroSD cards using brandjacking:**

![fake Huawei MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/huawei-fake.png){:width="200"}
![fake Xiaomi MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/xiaomi-fake.png){:width="200"} 
![fake Sony MicroSD card](/assets/images/microsd/sony-fake.png){:width="200"}

<sup>These examples were spotted on several online marketplaces and are all unofficial and will likely have a fake capacity and poor quality memory.</sup>

There are some cases where a brand will sell MicroSD cards, but counterfeit cards posing as non-existent models exist on online marketplaces, usually bearing a generic design or the design of another brand. It is advised to check the manufacturer's website to ensure they sell the displayed model if you are unsure.

### Where to buy genuine MicroSD cards?

There are various ways to ensure you are getting a genuine product.

- Always buy from a trusted & reputable big name retailer.
- Avoid buying MicroSD cards from online shopping marketplaces such as AliExpress, Wish, Temu & Shein.
- Some name brands like Sandisk, Samsung and Kingston have official online stores to buy genuine MicroSD cards directly from them. Other name brands will typically have a list of authorised sellers on their website.
    - Sandisk: [Online Store](https://shop.sandisk.com/product-portfolio/memory-cards/microsd-cards) --- [Authorised Sellers](https://shop.sandisk.com/company/distributors)
    - Samsung: [Online Store](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/)
    - Kingston: [Online Store](https://shop.kingston.com/collections/memory-cards/Memory-Card)
    - Lexar: [Authorised Sellers](https://www.lexar.com/global/store/)
    - Kioxia (Formerly Toshiba): [Authorised Sellers](https://europe.kioxia.com/en-europe/personal/support/buy.html)
    - This isn't a complete list, it is here to serve as an example.
- If you are buying from Amazon, ensure the product listing states that it is both "Sold" and "Shipped" by Amazon. "Fulfilled by Amazon" but sold by a different seller does not guarantee you will get a genuine product.
