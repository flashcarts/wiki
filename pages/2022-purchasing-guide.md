Footnotes:


* ¹ - Add-On's are funny beasts. Most are optical (not all). Some leverage the original console's processing, so *may* work with flashcarts. This Wiki will attempt completion, so as to remove confusion, whether flashcarts will or will not work.
* ² - not a footnote. Part of the Odyssey²'s branding.
* ³ - The PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and Mega Drive/Genesis both had handheld models, which used the same cartridge libraries. So, if you have a TurboExpress (or Analogue Pocket with adapter) or Sega Nomad, you'll be fine with their corresponding flashcarts. Of note, the Sega Game Gear was basically a Sega Master System under the hood (so, there are some weird kind-of-compatible considerations); unlike the PCE/TG16 and MD/Gen, they had completely different libraries and cartridge form factors, so will be treated differently as far as this list is concerned.
* ⁴ - The Mega-CD/Sega CD Add-on (as you'll see with others on this list, is a bit confusing, as it is not a cartridge-based system. That said, because it is still leveraging the Mega Drive/Genesis's processor, with the right flashcart, you may have success.
* ⁵ - There may be some debate as to whether the Neo Geo is a console or not. In many ways, the AES is *very* similar to the MVS. Regardless, it does have a flashcart.
* ⁶ - Totally not a word, but the Virtual Boy exists in-between being a handheld and a console (and you could (rightly) argue, these are all consoles).
* ⁶⁴ - not a footnote. Part of the N⁶⁴'s branding.
* ⁷ - The 32X is a confusing beast. As of the time of this writing, it doesn't currently have a shipping flashcart (do realize its entire library is only about 40 titles). On top of that, 32X-CD titles do exist (of which there are 6), which makes flashcarts just as confusing for it. They, too, do not have a shipping flash cart at the time of this edit.
* ⁸ - Where did all the consoles go? Well, after this point in time, consoles *mostly* went to optical (the biggest exception being the Nintendo Switch, but even then, Nintendo switched back to cartridges after three generations (Game Cube (6th), Wii (7th), and Wii U (8th)) of optical-based consoles.
* ⁹ - Around this time, Nintendo continued making beloved handhelds, but introduced *very* confusing marketing. Here's a little chart to help you understand the Game Boy Families (yes, plural) a little better:


|Generation|Model|Abbr.|Backwards Compatible|Notes|
--:|--:|--:|:--|:--|
|4th|Game Boy|GB|N/A|The Original, 4-bit! Not backward-compatible, as there was nothing before it, BUT, ~30% of the Game Boy Color's Library would run on original Game Boy Hardware, making it retroactively-forward-compatible. Game Boy Color Exclusives, will not. Confused? Just wait.|
|4th|Super Game Boy|SGB|It's hard-to-explain|Two of these add-on peripherals exist (1 & 2) that allow all "Game Boy Games" (some original, some color) to be played on a TV through a Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Some "Super Game Boy" Enhanced Titles (about 25% of the Game Boy's Library, 20% of the Game Boy Color's Library) have enhanced features. Some flashcarts support these.|
|5th|Game Boy Color|GBC|Yes|The updated, Color version of the Game Boy. Now 8-bits, it in someways was the handheld equivalent of an NES/FC, and in others, more powerful. 100% of Game Boy titles play on Game Boy Colors, and roughly 30% of Game Boy Color titles were designed to gracefully degrade into 4-bit mode to play on original Game Boy hardware. All known "Game Boy/Color flashcarts are just that: both Game Boy and Game Boy Color.|
|6th|Game Boy Advance|GBA|Yes|The Original, Landscape, 32-bit (quite a jump) Game Boy Advance model, this is where the confusion really starts to set in. Internally, these devices had both a Game Boy Advance and a Game Boy Color on device. Different notches on the cartridges told the system which system to boot into. As such, the Handheld will accept both GBA flashcarts and GB/C flashcarts; they will, in turn, boot the hardware into their respective modes. A GB/C flashcart will not run GBA games even when inserted into Game Boy Advance. Technically, GB/C games will **not** run off of GBA flashcart (for more info, see the Game Boy Micro, below).|
|6th|Game Boy Advance SP|GBA|Yes|The Clamshell form-factor, updated model. Most notably, it added a Light-Up screen (front or back lit) and lost the headphone jack (addable through an power-port adapter). Otherwise identical to the original Game Boy Advance in every way.|
|6th|Game Boy Micro|GBA|No|More confusion. It might be easy to think this is part of the Game Boy or Game Boy Color family, as it lost "Advance" from the title, unlike the SP. Instead, it IS part of the Game Boy Advance family (plays all Game Boy Advance titles), BUT, it lost its internal Game Boy Color hardware. That said, some GBA flashcarts will allow for the GB/C emulator "Goomba.gba" to run GB/C titles on GBA flashcarts; this applies to running a GBA flash cart on the original Game Boy Advance or SP, as well.|
|6th|Game Boy Advance Player|GBA|Yes|This is an Add-On for the GameCube. Unlike the Game Boy Micro, it retains the internal Game Boy Color hardware, making it compatible with both GBA flashcarts, and GB/C flashcarts. GBA flashcarts should emulate GB/C titles, just fine. Phwew.|


* ¹⁰ - Oh, it has one. It's real. And it's spectacular.
* ¹¹ - Like the Game Boy Families, the DS Families are just as, if not more confusing. Here goes:


|Generation|Model|Sub-Family|"Abbr."|Backwards Compatible|Notes|
--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|:--|
|7th|[Original/Tank] DS [Phat]|DS|N/DS|"Kind-of"|The original Nintendo DS. Also known as The Tank DS (due to its shape) or DS Phat (although none of these were official, and, like World War I, didn't get these names until the sequel). Had two slots: Slot 1 for brand-new, *shiny* DS titles, and Slot 2 for Game Boy Advance titles. As such, it can use two types of flashcarts: DS ("R4") and GBA (not GB/C, although these titles are emulatable). In a similar move to forward compatible Game Boy Color games for the original Game Boy, this model can play DSi-Enhanced titles, without DSi features. Cannot play DSiWare or DSi-Exclusive titles. Needs no modification for DS/"R4" flashcart use.|
|7th|DS Lite|DS|DSL|"Kind-of"|Identical in every way to the original DS, save for form factor size. It's smaller. All flashcarts notes above apply here.|
|7th|DSi|DSi|DSi|Yes|The mostly-same size form-factor as the DS lite (they're slightly bigger), and the original member of the DSi family. The DSi added more of an operating system to the DS line (although it's truly a DSi). The DSi lost Slot 2, so GBA flashcarts will not work with this system; there is a rare flashcart that has extra processing power for emulating GBA games on a DSi device. Nintendo blocked almost all flashcarts with operating system updates, so modding your DSi family system will be necessary to use almost any flashcart (while at the same time, removing almost every advantage a flashcart provides). The DSi added an external camera and SD card slot to its hardware. It plays all DS games. It added three new types of games: DSiWare (downloaded, and installed to the system; incompatible with all but one very rare flashcart and DS Sub-Family systems), DSi-Enhanced titles (forward compatible with DS Sub-Family systems, although they lose DSi features), and DSi-Exclusive titles (only playable on DSi Sub-Family Systems; incompatible with all but one very rare flashcart and DS Sub-Family systems; roughly 6 titles exist). Confusingly, still a part of the 7th-generation of Video Game Handhelds.|
|7th|DSi-XL|DSi|DSiXL|Yes|Identical to the DSi in every way, except for larger form factor, fewer and more "mature" colors (really; this was Nintendo's strategy), and every model ships with two IPS (instead of TN) screens. All DSi flashcart information applies to the DSi-XL.|
|8th|[Original] 3DS|[Original-]3DS|o3DS|Yes|The original 3DS (abbreviated as o3DS for "old" (as opposed to "new") or "original) is approximately the same form factor as the DS Lite and DSi. It introduced an even newer type of format/games to Nintendo's already confusing line-up: 3DS titles. Most significantly, these introduced "stereoscopic" (no need for glasses) 3D and needing significantly more processing power. These titles were available both via retail cartridges or, similar to DSiWare, downloadable from the (then) new eShop; some titles were only available in one or the other medium. The 3DS could play all DS titles, DSi-Enhanced titles, DSi-Exclusive titles and DSiWare titles, however, the same rules for DSi flashcarts apply to the 3DS when considering these levels of games. The o3DS can play all "3DS" titles, all "new-3DS-Enhanced" titles (with either reduced features or additional hardware (such as the amiibo reader or external C-Stick), but no "new-3DS-Exclusive" titles (or which there are approximately 15). 3DS flashcarts *exist*, technically speaking, but should be avoided at all costs (due to bricking, exorbitant pricing, etc.); 3DS flashcarts are NOT needed to run DS or DSi-Enhanced titles: most DS/"R4" flashcarts will run just fine (but may require modding the 3DS system).|
|8th|[Original] 3DS-XL|[Original-]3DS|o3DSXL|Yes|Same as the "original" 3DS (o3DS) in every way, minus the larger form factor (which mimics the DSi-XL, approximately).|
|8th|[Original] 2DS|[Original-]3DS|o2DS|Yes|Internally, an "original" 3DS (o3DS) in every way, minus the 3D hardware (and thus effect). It introduced radically different form factor, affectionately known as the "Bread Slice." The only 2-Screen Nintendo handheld that does fold as a clamshell. It was a cheaper model, designed for younger players.|
|8th|"New" 3DS|New 3DS|n3DS|Yes|Identical to the "original" 3DS in almost every way including form-factor, it introduced trigger buttons, a built-in C-Stick, better 3D but with major processing and memory improvements. It allowed for new-3DS-Enhanced titles (allowing original-3DS Sub-Family systems to play without improvements) and new-3DS-Exclusive titles (incompatible with the original-3DS Sub-Family). All original 3DS flashcart (and DS flashcart) information applies here: DS flashcarts are fine, but require modding; 3DS flashcarts should be avoided at all costs.|
|8th|"New" 3DS-XL|New 3DS|n3DSXL|Yes|Identical to the "New" 3DS, minus the larger form-factor, which is meant to match the 3DS-XL (o3DSXL). All 3DS flashcart ideologies apply.|
|8th|"New" 2DS-XL|New 3DS|n2DSXL|Yes|The "New" 2DS-XL (n2DSXL) sandwiches the "New" 3DS hardware, the "New 3DS-XL size (roughly) and clamshell folding, and the "original" 2DS lack-of-3D and price-savings-intent into some very good-looking hardware. All 3DS flashcart ideologies apply.|

**Coming up:** Two more charts: one for optical drive equivalents; one for systems that should be modded instead of flashcarted-or-optical-drive-equivalized (as, they don't exist).
