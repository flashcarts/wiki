**Please *only* follow the installation if your cart is listed! Using YSMenu on any other cart can result in a PERMANENT BRICK!

## DSOnei SDHC YSMenu folder
- DSONE SDHC (and its future clones) (The non-SDHC version is NOT supported)
- DSONEi
- DSONEi mini

## M3Real_M3iZero YSMenu folder
- **The following carts will work as-is**:
    - M3 DS Real
    - M3i Zero (the GMP-Z003 version is NOT supported)
- **For the following carts, also download the [iTouchDS bootstrap for YSMenu](https://gbatemp.net/download/37368/)**:
    - iTouchDS
    - R4(i) SDHC (r4rts.com)
    - R4 SDHC RTS black version (r4isdhc.com)

## R4SDHC YSMenu folder
- This folder is up to speculation, but if your cart has no URL, has the "R4" logo and the "SDHC" logo, then this is probably supported. Looks similar to [this image here](https://i.redd.it/sy1w7d1s2fc81.jpg).
- Some OG R4 SDHC's are actually DSTTi "demon" clones. If it looks like the cart linked above but boots to a `Menu?` screen when an empty sd is inserted, it may instead use the `R4i-SDHC YSMenu` folder.

## R4-Clone YSMenu folder
- This requires your original kernel to be installed: however, I do not recommend this way of running games for the Original R4. Use its dedicated kernel instead.
- The rest are probably useful:
    - R4-III (r4iiinew.com)
    - All carts from r4-pro.com
    - R4-III (r4dsl.net)
    - N5 (dsn5.com)
    - R4iNDSiXL (r4indsill.com)
    - R4 SDHC Christmas Edition (only this cart, running it on any other r4isdhc.com cart may BRICK!) (r4isdhc.com)

## R4i-SDHC YSMenu folder
- **The following carts will work as-is**:
    - Most r4i-sdhc.com carts
    - All 2014+ r4isdhc.com carts (**not** the .com.cn, **not** the .hk, just .com)
    - Any r4i-sdhc.com.tw carts that didn't work with DSTTi-Clone YSMenu
    - Any r4i-dshc.com carts that didn't work with DSTTi-Clone YSMenu
    - R4i Advance (r4i-advance.com)
    - R4-III(i) (r4dsl.net)
    - R4i SDHC v2.07 (r4sdhc.com)
    - All r4i.cn carts
    - R4i Pocket (r4ipocket.com)
    - R4i Gold 3DS (r4i-gold.cc)
    - r4i-gold.com v1.4/1.4.1 carts WITHOUT A YEAR NUMBER AND WITHOUT 3DS (non-RTS), ANY WITH A YEAR NUMBER OR 3DS WILL BRICK!
    - R4xDS (r4xds.com)
    - Some r4ita.com carts - If this fails, try DSTTi Clone folder
    - r4r4.be - R4i-SDHC variant
    - All r4i-gold.eu carts
    - R4i SDHC v1.41 (r4ixl-sdhc.com)
- **For the following carts, download this [R4.dat](http://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/YSMenu/DEMON_common/R4.dat) and replace it with the pre-existing one**:
    - Any r4i-sdhc.com cart that didn't work as-is
    - Any r4i-gold.com cart that didn't work as-is, WITHOUT A YEAR NUMBER AND WITHOUT 3DS (non-RTS), ANY WITH A YEAR NUMBER OR 3DS WILL BRICK!
    - Any r4ixl-sdhc.com cart that didnt work as is
