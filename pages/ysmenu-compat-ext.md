## DSTTi-Clone YSMenu folder

DSTTi-Clone **TTMenu** has broken homebrew loading, and will only work to play retail games. Therefore, it's advised to only use YSMenu.

## DSOnei SDHC YSMenu folder
- DSONE SDHC (and its future clones) (The non-SDHC version is NOT supported)
- DSONEi
- DSONEi mini

## M3Real_M3iZero YSMenu folder
- **The following carts will work as-is**:
    - M3 DS Real
    - M3i Zero (the GMP-Z003 version is NOT supported)
- **For the following carts, also download the [iTouchDS bootstrap for YSMenu](https://gbatemp.net/download/37368/)**:
    - iTouchDS
    - R4(i) SDHC (r4rts.com)
    - R4 SDHC RTS black version (r4isdhc.com)

## R4SDHC YSMenu folder
This was meant for the [Original R4SDHC from r4sdhc.com](https://i.redd.it/sy1w7d1s2fc81.jpg). However, this folder is currently broken because of a configuration error in the `YSMenu.ini` file. It's setup to use the stock R4SDHC 1.34 kernel to autoboot YSMenu as `DEFAULT.NDS`. However, YSMenu also autoboots any file named `DEFAULT.NDS`, so YSMenu ends up autobooting itself forever.
{:.alert .alert-info}

- Some OG R4 SDHC's are actually DSTTi "DEMON" clones. If it looks like [this cart](https://i.redd.it/sy1w7d1s2fc81.jpg) but boots to a `Menu?` screen when an empty sd is inserted, it will use DSTTi-Clone YSMenu with a bootstrap `R4.dat` from the "DEMON DSTTi Clones" section above.
- For actual Original R4SDHC carts from r4sdhc.com, it's advised to use R4-Clone YSMenu, listed below.

## R4-Clone YSMenu folder

This is a YSMenu version for the Original R4, and clones + derivatives. Some carts will need the original kernel to be installed to launch `YSMenu.nds`, while others may have autoboot solutions available.
{:.alert .alert-info}

- Note that using YSMenu on the Original R4 and M3 Simply is not advised, as [WoodR4](https://archive.flashcarts.net/R4_original_M3_Simply) is a more compatible kernel for them. R4-Clone YSMenu does work on these carts however if you prefer YSMenu over WoodR4. You may use the [nds-miniboot project](https://github.com/asiekierka/nds-miniboot) to autoboot YSMenu as `BOOT.NDS`
    - However for R4SDHC and its clones, as well as N5 and its clones, YSMenu is the best kernel available. For those, see below:

---

- For the [Original R4SDHC from r4sdhc.com](https://i.redd.it/sy1w7d1s2fc81.jpg):
    - Use R4-Clone YSMenu folder, then place [this `_DS_MENU.DAT` file](https://archive.flashcarts.net/YSMenu/R4SDHC_common/_DS_MENU.DAT) on the SD root as well.

- For the N5 from dsn5.com:
    - Use R4-Clone YSMenu folder, and rename `YSMenu.nds` to `_DS_MENU.DAT`. Copy `_AX_MENU.DAT` from the [stock kernel](https://archive.flashcarts.net/dsn5.com/dsn5.com_N5_Kernel_1.32.zip) to the SD root as well.

- For the R4 Upgrade/R4-III from r4dsl.net, r4iii.com, r4iiinew.com, and r4-dsl.net:
    - Use R4-Clone YSMenu folder, and rename `YSMenu.nds` to `_DS_MENU.DAT`. Copy `_R4__III.DAT` from the [stock kernel](https://archive.flashcarts.net/r4dsl.net_r4iiinew.com_r4iii.com_iii.phqy.net/old/r4dsl.net_Kernel_3.13.zip) to the SD root as well.
    - If it doesn't work on the first try, delete `_DS_MENU.DAT` from the SD, and recopy `YSMenu.nds` to the SD, renaming it to `_DS_MENU.DAT`. Do not delete the existing `_R4__III.DAT`.

---

- The following carts are also compatible with R4-Clone YSMenu but may need their stock kernel to load YSMenu from:
    - R4iNDSiXL (r4indsill.com)
    - R4 SDHC Christmas Edition (r4isdhc.com)

## R4i-SDHC YSMenu folder
This was meant for r4i-sdhc.com carts, and related DSTTi DEMON hardware carts. While it does work, it does not reliably work on all DEMON carts, as some will refuse to boot with it. r4i-gold.eu carts are a common example, but some older r4i-sdhc.com carts also fail to boot R4i-SDHC YSMenu. Instead of using the `R4.dat` from this folder, an nds-miniboot binary that works on all carts can be used to load YSMenu. As such, these carts have been moved to the "DEMON DSTTi Clones" sub-section above.
