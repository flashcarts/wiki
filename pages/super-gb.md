## Software

As far as software goes, Super Game Boy (SGB) was not a game format per se, but rather bonus features (mostly borders and "expanded" color palettes) that could be added to both Game Boy (roughly 25% of the Game Boy Library) and Game Boy Color (roughly 20% of the Game Boy Color Library) titles.

## Hardware

As far as hardware goes, the Super Game Boy had two editions the "1" (not what it was called, but what it became known as, after the sequel) and the 2 (what it was called; Japan exclusive) that allowed ***all*** Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to be played on a Super Famicom (SFC) or Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) connected to a Television (TV). If it was a "dumb" Game Boy or Game Boy Color game (75% and 80% of respective libraries), it would cycle through different color palettes (although it did recognize some "dumb" titles (i.e. *Metroid II: The Return of Samus*) and default to specific color palettes) and have some generic borders (as TV dimensions ≠ Game Boy/Color dimensions; pixel-scaling; math). Super Game Boy Enhanced titles had their own game-specific borders AND black-magic™ color palettes (so they could cram "more" than 4-bits of color on screen).

## Great, What Does This Have To Do with Flashcarts?, I: Game Boy Content on Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hardware

*Does this work?* Yes. Yes it does. Kind of. Mostly. Here's a (probably incomplete) handy-dandy chart:

|Status|Make|Brand|Model|Does It Work/Show SGB Content in addition to Game Boy Content on a Super Game Boy in a SFC/SNES?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GB X7|Original GB SGB-Enhanced, only.|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GB X5|Original GB SGB-Enhanced, only.|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GB X3|Original GB SGB-Enhanced, only.|
|Legacy|Krikzz|Everdrive|GB|Original GB SGB-Enhanced, only.|
|Shipping|EZ|EZ-Flash|Junior|No. Nothing. Period.|

Note: a working GB/C flashcart won't magically make a non-SGB-Enhanced title suddenly SGB-Enhanced.


## Great, What Does This Have To Do with Flashcarts?, II: Well, How Else Can I Experience the Magic and Wonder of SGB Content (but mostly just the borders)?

Well, here's another handy-less-dandy-but-still-dandy chart:

|Status|Make|Brand|Scenario/Set-up|Can I SGB Content via this Flashcart-esque set-up?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Some|Krikzz|Super Everdrive-esque|[Varies]|No exhaustive list to date, but some models will, possibly with custom firmware|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GB Xx|No. Are you mad? Where would the borders fit?|
|"Shipping"|Analogue|Analogue Pocket|via Everdrive GB Xx|Supposedly, yes, in the 1.1 firmware update.|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GBA X5|via the "Goomba.gba" emulator: Game Boy-SGB-Enhanced, yes. Game Boy Color-SGB-Ehnhanced, no (or, undetermined as to how).|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GB Xx crammed into a GameCube Game Boy Player|Game Boy-SGB-Enhanced, yes. Game Boy Color-SGB-Ehnhanced, no (or, undetermined as to how).|
|Shipping|Krikzz|Everdrive|GBA X5 crammed into a GameCube Game Boy Player|via the "Goomba.gba" emulator: Game Boy-SGB-Enhanced, yes. Game Boy Color-SGB-Ehnhanced, no (or, undetermined as to how).|
