This page exists as an answer to "Which flashcart should I buy for ntrboot?". Flashcarts which we recommend over others in a category are in **bold**. <br/>
We would recommend buying an **[Ace3DS X](?tab=preflashed#ace3ds-x)** due to it's ability to switch between it's DS firmware and ntrboot firmware. Other options are mentioned on this list if you are unable to obtain this cart.

## READ FIRST

1. Carts flashed with ntrboot will not appear on your console's home screen. This is normal, **your flashcart isn't broken**. The only exception to this is the Acekard 2i.
1. Some carts may look similar to those listed on this page, however, they may not be compatible with ntrboot. See the '[Carts to avoid](?tab=avoid)' tab for more information.
1. Do not use 'R4' websites for purchasing flashcarts. Many are scammy and don't refund orders. Stick to more general places like eBay or AliExpress.
   - Amazon is also not generally recommended as flashcarts are generally extremely over priced compared to eBay and AliExpress.
   - The exception to the R4 site rule is NDS-Card, hence why we have links to their site for most flashcarts.
1. If you already have a flashcart and want to see if it can be flashed with ntrboot, have a look at this page: [https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot). <br/>As mentioned in a point above, some carts may look similar to ntrboot carts, make sure to verify that your cart really does support ntrboot before attempting to flash it.

## Flashcarts

{% capture tab-preflashed %}
These carts come pre-flashed with the ntrboot firmware. If you have one of these carts, you can jump straight into installing boot9strap: [https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(ntrboot)](https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(ntrboot))

## **Ace3DS X**
![Ace3DS X](/assets/images/ds_carts/ace3dsx.png){:.float-start .me-3} 

This flashcart requires a microSD card to be inserted for it to be detected by your console, neither the DS mode nor the ntrboot mode will work without it. The DS mode is the normal Ace3DS+ experience, you add the kernel files and then your games! However, **do not flash this mode with ntrboot**. Instead, flip the switch on the side of the cart to 3DS mode. 3DS mode is ntrboot firmware, when the cart is in 3DS mode, it will disappear from your home screen - this is normal and it means that you are now in ntrboot mode.

### Purchase links and kernel downloads

This cart usually costs $5-$10 USD. Searching "ace3ds" seems to correctly return results on AliExpress, however, we cannot guarantee that you will receive the flashcart. A link to a listing is provided here though it may not be the cheapest option out there: [NDS-Card](https://www.nds-card.com/ProShow.asp?ProID=575) / [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005616167352.html)

## R4i-SDHC B9S
![R4i-SDHC B9S](/assets/images/ds_carts/r4i-sdhc_b9s.png){:.float-start .me-3} 

This cart does **not** have a switch for different modes. It's one of r4i-sdhc.com's timebomb carts which has been pre-flashed with ntrboot. You can flash it back to a state where it can play DS games again. <br/>The stock kernel for this cart has a timebomb set for the 3rd of September, 2024. You should use YSMenu instead as it does not have a timebomb. See our [Timebomb Misconceptions](ds-timebomb) page for more details.

These carts will need to be flashed with ntrboot as they come with their DS firmware from factory. Flashing one of these carts is easy though, you can find out how to do that here: [https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot](https://3ds.hacks.guide/ntrboot)

## **R4iSDHC.com 2014+**
![r4isdhc gold pro](/assets/images/ds_carts/r4isdhc_com_front.png){:.float-start .me-3} 

It doesn't matter whether you get the Gold Pro, or the Dual Core, or any other cart from r4isdhc.com, as long as the year number is 2014 or above - you can use the cart with ntrboot. Carts pre-2014 are not compatible with ntrboot. You must ensure that this is an r4isdhc**.com** cart, other similar looking carts mentioned in the '[Carts to avoid](?tab=avoid)' tab cannot use ntrboot. 

The 4.1b kernel for this cart hosted by r4i-sdhc.com has a broken ROM loader - older versions of the stock kernel have a timebomb - you should use YSMenu instead as it does not have the issues mentioned before. See our [Timebomb Misconceptions](ds-timebomb) page for more details.

You should use YSMenu instead as it does not have a timebomb. See our [Timebomb Misconceptions](ds-timebomb) page for more details.

## DSTT
![DSTT](/assets/images/ds_carts/dstt.png){:.float-start .me-3}   

**This cart will not work on a stock DSi/3DS, only buy this cart if you have a DS/DS Lite**. [Only certain flashchips are compatible](https://gist.github.com/aspargas2/fa2a70aed3a7fe33f1f10bc264d9fab6), while the purchase links here have sent out compatible DSTT carts, we cannot guarantee that this is what you will recieve. 

Consider other options on this list before deciding if you really want to buy a DSTT.

This section is a warning against buying certain carts for ntrboot. These carts may look and sound similar to other ntrboot carts.
{:.alert .alert-warning}

## Generic Ace3DS+ clones
![208in1](/assets/images/ds_carts/208in1.png){:.float-start .me-3}  ![Unlabelled Ace3DS+](/assets/images/ds_carts/ace3ds-nolabel.png){:.float-start .me-3}

These carts do not support being flashed with ntrboot. While they are known as Ace3DS+ clones, the hardware is different enough that attempting to flash them with ntrboot will not work! 

These carts usually go by 'X in 1' or 'R4 WOOD' - X referring to the number of games stored on the included micro SD card.

## r4isdhc.hk carts

![r4isdhc.hk](/assets/images/ds_carts/r4isdhc_hk.png){:.float-start .me-4}

This Ace3DS+ clone looks similar to an r4isdhc.com cart and is often mistaken as one. 

Key differences to look out for are: 
- The site listed on the cart. 
- This cart has a [red PCB](/assets/images/ds_carts/ace3ds-nolabel.png), 2014+ r4isdhc.com carts have a [yellow PCB](/assets/images/ds_carts/r4isdhc_com_back.png).
- The way the year number is displayed - instead of a red ribbon as shown on the r4isdhc.com 2014+ carts, r4isdhc.hk carts have an outline of a star. 

This cart does not support being flashed with ntrboot firmware.

## r4isdhc.com.cn carts 

![r4isdhc.com.cn](/assets/images/ds_carts/r4isdhc_com_cn.png){:.float-start .me-4}

This Ace3DS+ clone looks similar to an r4isdhc.com cart and is often mistaken as one. 

Key differenced to look out for are: 
- The site listed on the cart. 
- This cart has a [red PCB](/assets/images/ds_carts/ace3ds-nolabel.png), 2014+ r4isdhc.com carts have a [yellow PCB](/assets/images/ds_carts/r4isdhc_com_back.png).
- This cart has a reflective sticker, whereas r4isdhc.com's labels are not reflective.

Earlier carts (~2017) from r4isdhc.com.cn supported being flashed with ntrboot - it could not be flashed back to it's DS firmware meaning it would forever be an ntrboot cart. Newer carts (2020+) do not support being flashed with ntrboot.
